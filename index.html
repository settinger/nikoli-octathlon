      <p id="akari-rules">
        <b>Akari</b> (depends on Hitori, dependee of Shikaku)<br />
        See <a href="https://mellowmelon.wordpress.com/akari/">here</a> for the
        rules to Akari.<br />
        The walls are not given to you in this puzzle. The black cells in the
        solution to the Hitori puzzle are exactly the locations of the walls.
        Any wall with a number represents a typical numeric clue in Akari. Any
        number without a wall is a fake clue and should be ignored. Light bulbs
        are allowed to be placed on top of fake numbers.
      </p>
      <p id="shikaku-rules">
        <b>Shikaku</b> (depends on Akari, dependee of Heyawake)<br />
        See <a href="https://www.janko.at/Raetsel/Sikaku/index.htm">here</a> for
        the rules to Shikaku.<br />
        A lot of extra numbers are given in this puzzle. Overlay the light bulbs
        in the Akari solution on this puzzle. Only those numbers which have a
        lightbulb on top of them are true clues in this puzzle. All other
        numbers should be ignored; they may or may not denote the correct size
        of the rectangle that contains them.
      </p>
      <p id="heyawake-rules">
        <b>Heyawake</b> (depends on Shikaku, dependee of Nurikabe)<br />
        See <a href="https://www.janko.at/Raetsel/Heyawake/">here</a> and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heyawake">here</a> for the rules
        to Heyawake.<br />
        The rooms are not given to you in this puzzle. The rectangles in the
        solution to the Shikaku are where the rooms are. Only those numbers
        appearing in the top left cell of a room should be used as clues. All
        other numbers should be ignored.
      </p>
      <p id="nurikuro-rules">
        <b>Nurikabe, featuring Kurodoko</b> (depends on Heyawake, dependee of
        Fillomino)<br />
        See <a href="https://mellowmelon.wordpress.com/nurikabe/">here</a> for
        the rules to Nurikabe. See
        <a href="https://www.janko.at/Raetsel/Kuromasu/index.htm">here</a> and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kuromasu">here</a> for the rules
        to Kurodoko (which is sometimes called Kuromasu).<br />
        A Nurikabe and a Kurodoko puzzle have been superimposed on each other.
        The solution to the Heyawake puzzle and the Kurodoko puzzle are
        identical. Each number in this puzzle is the location of a clue in both
        the Nurikabe and Kurodoko, and the number is the sum of the clues in
        each of the puzzles (i.e. if there is a Nurikabe 1 and a Kurodoko 6 in
        the same space, a 7 will appear in this puzzle).
      </p>
      <p id="fillomino-rules">
        <b>Fillomino</b> (depends on Nurikabe, dependee of Country Road)<br />
        See <a href="https://mellowmelon.wordpress.com/fillomino/">here</a> for
        the rules to Fillomino.<br />
        A lot of extra numbers are given in this puzzle. Overlay the Nurikabe
        solution on this puzzle. All numbers covered by a black cell in the
        Nurikabe solution are liars and <i>are not the correct number</i>. All
        numbers covered by white cells are truth-tellers.
      </p>
      <p id="country-road-rules">
        <b>Country Road</b> (depends on Fillomino, dependee of Corral)<br />
        See
        <a href="https://mellowmelon.wordpress.com/country-road/">here</a> for
        the rules to Country Road.<br />
        The rooms are not given to you in this puzzle. Overlay the Fillomino
        solution; it gives the shape of all of the rooms. Each room will contain
        no number or one number, which functions as a standard Country Road clue
        for that room. The number can appear in anywhere in the room.
        <i>
          Note: nikoliâ€™s rules require every room to be visited exactly once.
          This rule does <b>not</b> apply to this puzzle.
        </i>
      </p>
      <p id="corralsyu-rules">
        <b>Corral, featuring Masyu</b> (depends on Country Road, dependee of
        Hitori)<br />
        See <a href="https://mellowmelon.wordpress.com/corral/">here</a> for the
        rules to Corral. See
        <a href="https://mellowmelon.wordpress.com/masyu/">here</a> for the
        rules to Masyu.<br />
        The grid is filled with Corral clues in black or white circles, but not
        all of the Corral clues are correct. Overlay the solution to the Country
        Road puzzle on this one. Cross off all of the circled numbers for which
        that colored circle would not be a valid Masyu clue in the Country Road
        solution. All of the numbers that are left are the clues to the Corral
        puzzle. (the numbers that are crossed off may or may not be correct)
      </p>
      <p id="hitorilink-rules">
        <b>Hitori, featuring Slitherlink</b> (depends on Corral, dependee of
        Akari)<br />
        See
        <a href="https://www.janko.at/Raetsel/Hitori/index.htm">here</a> and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hitori">here</a> for the rules to
        Hitori. See
        <a href="https://mellowmelon.wordpress.com/slitherlink/">here</a> for
        the rules to Slitherlink.<br />
        A Hitori and a Slitherlink puzzle have been superimposed on each other.
        The solution to the Corral puzzle and the Slitherlink puzzle are
        identical. The Slitherlink puzzle gives a number in every square, just
        as the Hitori does. All of the Hitori clues are numbers from 1 to 10.
        Each number that appears in this puzzle is the <i>units digit</i> of the
        sum of the Hitori and Slitherlink clues. For instance, in a space where
        the Slitherlink has a 3 and the Hitori has an 8, a 1 would be written in
        this puzzle.
